# AOK
The HTTP server that will always tell you things are AOK

## Details

The AOK HTTP server is a basic web server that can be used to bounce requests off of. This is helpful for testing any sort of client software where you just want to beat on a server and always throw you a 200. Examples would be things like fuzzing software (Codenomicon or Peach Fuzz), curl, or for security testing passthrough devices such as IPS or application firewalls.
